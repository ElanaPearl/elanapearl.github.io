As an example, we use the Blood Brain Barrier Permeability (BBBP) dataset from <a href="http://moleculenet.ai/datasets-1" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MoleculeNet</a> for our visualizations and the code tutorial. This dataset has measurements from over 2000 unique compounds, many of which are approved drugs, each labeled as “permeable” or “not permeable”. We look into the details of how this dataset gets embedded by various dimensionality reduction methods and reveal some fascinating properties of UMAP.</p> <p>For a walkthrough using this dataset of how to use UMAP to visualize chemical space, see <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/gist/ElanaPearl/444b3331f61485bbe8862db27cb2b968/mapping-chemical-space-with-umap.ipynb" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">this</a> Colab notebook:</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/ElanaPearl/444b3331f61485bbe8862db27cb2b968.js"></script> <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2> <p>A fundamental assumption behind most machine learning methods is that data are independent and identically distributed (IID). However, in drug discovery datasets, compounds are almost never sampled independently, as they are typically extracted from experiments for specific therapeutic programs. Measurements often follow the patterns of the drug development efforts that generate them. Any biases in the data-generation process can also sneak into the training and evaluation of models. In practice, this means that open source and industry datasets are often “clumpy”, consisting of measurements for compounds that are very similar to one another and non-uniformly cover chemical space. Visualizing the chemical space of a dataset does not solve these issues, but it helps us better understand them within the context of our datasets.</p> <p>At Reverie Labs, we work with dozens of datasets spanning a range of different properties. When ingesting a new dataset, we begin with a systematized analysis that identifies biases and helps determine how best to prepare and use the dataset for modeling. As with most machine learning problems, we want to understand the distribution of the measured property we are modeling (What is the class balance within a classification dataset? Does our regression dataset have truncated measurements due to assay limits? etc.) We want to make sure the measurements look reasonable and compare their distributions in our training and test data. However, we cannot stop there. We must also look at the distribution of the chemical structures that the measurements are taken from because the compounds themselves are typically selected from a biased generation process.</p> <div class="l-gutter"> <p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/umap_post/data_doodle-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/umap_post/data_doodle-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/umap_post/data_doodle-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/umap_post/data_doodle.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </p> </div> <p>Visualizing the distribution of our compounds in chemical space allows us to gauge how much we expect models trained on a given dataset to generalize to new chemical matter. These visualizations can help with manual inspection of Structure-Activity / Structure-Property Relationships (SAR/SPR), expose potential quirks or biases in the dataset, and reveal insights for how we might want to split the dataset into training and evaluation sets. These are many methods we can use for visualizing chemical space, but at Reverie, we have selected a default procedure involving UMAP that optimizes accuracy, speed, and ease-of-use.</p> <h2 id="embeddings">Embeddings</h2> <p>That sounds great, but how do we actually visualize these distributions? The key here is that we need to embed our compounds into a low-dimensional vector form that can be easily interpreted (in this post we stick to 2D for simplicity’s sake but 3D would also work). Representing our molecules as <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci100050t" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2048-bit Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs)</a> gives us high dimensional vectors that we can then project into a 2-dimensional space for visualization. <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.PCA.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PCA</a> and <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">t-SNE</a> are commonly used for this kind of dimensionality reduction, and have been used for many biology and chemistry purposes. Since usage of these tools has been thoroughly documented, here we focus on the utility of a more recent addition to the dimensionality reduction repertoire: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UMAP</a>.</p> <p>Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) constructs a high-dimensional graph representation of the entire dataset then tries to re-create a low dimensional version of this initial graph that maintains as much of the local and global structure as possible. This method is somewhat similar to t-SNE, but with a few key differences that lead to important advantages for our purposes. The technical differences between UMAP and t-SNE would take up a full blog post, so we will not detail them here but more details can be found in these resources: <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.03426.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the original paper</a>, <a href="https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Understanding UMAP</a> or <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/how-exactly-umap-works-13e3040e1668" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">How Exactly UMAP Works</a>.</p> <p>The most relevant benefits UMAP provides us are speed, the ability to maintain some of the local / global structure of the data, and an easy interface for applying an embedding from one dataset to a different dataset.</p> <h3 id="speed">Speed</h3> <p>To evaluate the speed of these methods, we compute ECFPs of various sizes and embed each using each PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP:</p> <div class="l-body"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/umap_post/timing_plot-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/umap_post/timing_plot-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/umap_post/timing_plot-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/umap_post/timing_plot.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>We can see that PCA is the most efficient, UMAP is slightly less efficient, and t-SNE is by far the least efficient. For small datasets, these time differences are not particularly relevant, but they really add up as the number of compounds grows. To be fair, we used the most generic implementations (PCA and t-SNE from <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sklearn</a>) and there are more efficient variants of t-SNE. However, the <a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/performance.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UMAP Docs</a> contain a similar performance analysis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MNIST</a>, including a wider variety of the performant methods, and find similar results.</p> <p>Additionally, the creators of UMAP recently released a new version of the algorithm, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12981" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ParametricUMAP</a>, that uses a neural network to reduce the dimensions of the graphical embedding, giving it even greater speed improvements. For this post we stick to the original, non-parametric UMAP, but if you want to optimize the speed of embedding new compounds into a pre-fit UMAP model, ParametricUMAP can be quite useful.</p> <h3 id="local--global-structure">Local / Global Structure</h3> <p>If PCA is so fast, why don’t we just use that? Our goal is to understand both the local structure (organization of similar compounds) and global structure (organization of groups of different compounds) of complex datasets. Speed is important, but we also evaluate the methods according to how informative they are for those tasks. We can use the example BBBP dataset to explore the local and global structure of the embeddings created by the various methods:</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/umap_post/pca_original-2-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/umap_post/pca_original-2-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/umap_post/pca_original-2-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/umap_post/pca_original-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/umap_post/tsne_original--1-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/umap_post/tsne_original--1-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/umap_post/tsne_original--1-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/umap_post/tsne_original--1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/umap_post/umap_original-3-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/umap_post/umap_original-3-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/umap_post/umap_original-3-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/umap_post/umap_original-3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Click these links for interactive versions of the plots [<a href="https://reverie-public.s3.amazonaws.com/interactive_BBBP_plots/PCA_original.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PCA</a>, <a href="https://reverie-public.s3.amazonaws.com/interactive_BBBP_plots/TSNE_original.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">t-SNE</a>, <a href="https://reverie-public.s3.amazonaws.com/interactive_BBBP_plots/UMAP_original.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UMAP</a>]</p> <p>At a first glance, we notice some high-level differences in the overall structures of the embeddings. PCA looks like the intersection of two orthogonal lines, and the compounds within them are somewhat uniformly distributed. t-SNE has a flowery shape that resembles a 2D gaussian, with a variety of isolated clusters around the edges. UMAP has many disjoint, tight clusters that do not follow a specific pattern. Beyond surface-level observations, we cannot ascertain much more about these embeddings from these plots alone. To do that, we need to look more into the actual compounds that are represented in these images.</p> <p>These links [<a href="https://reverie-public.s3.amazonaws.com/interactive_BBBP_plots/PCA_original.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">PCA</a>, <a href="https://reverie-public.s3.amazonaws.com/interactive_BBBP_plots/TSNE_original.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">t-SNE</a>, <a href="https://reverie-public.s3.amazonaws.com/interactive_BBBP_plots/UMAP_original.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">UMAP</a>] take you to pages with interactive views of these plots, which is how we typically examine our datasets. Exploring the data in an interactive form helps builds intuition for how the different algorithms organize the chemical space of the dataset.

If we assume the global distances between clusters are meaningful, this implies that the <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> are more unique from the rest of the dataset than the <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracycline</span> are. 2) While the <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroid</span> compounds are spread out within their cluster, the <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span> are all embedded practically on top of each other. If we assume the spread of a cluster reflects the local diversity, this implies that the <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> are more diverse than the <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span>. 3) The two clusters are relatively near each other. If we assume the relationships between clusters are meaningful, this implies that these clusters are more similar to each-other than they are to the rest of the dataset.</p> <p>To evaluate whether these assumptions about the global and local structure are true, we can examine the validity of the claims they imply. Should <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> be placed farther away from the rest of the compounds than the <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span> are? Both groups appear to stand out from the rest of the dataset, but it is difficult to manually compare their levels of uniqueness. Should tetracyclines and <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> actually be placed near each other? Given that both groups contain 4-fused ring systems, it seems reasonable for them to be located near each other but this similarity could just be superficial. To more quantitatively address these questions we look at the measured similarities between steroids, <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span>, and the rest of the compounds in the dataset. For each <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroid</span> compound, we calculate its average similarity to the other steroids, the <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span>, and every other compound.

Local structure is expressed by maintaining the local diversity of groups through their intra-group distribution. There actually is an even more detailed level of local structure hidden in these embeddings that we’ll examine later, but given the information we have so far these are the main conclusions. The embedding of two groups of compounds does not prove anything about UMAP that we expect to hold up for all embeddings. But their examples highlight important patterns in how chemical datasets get embedded.</p> <p>We can compare UMAP’s arrangement of the <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> and <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span> with PCA and t-SNE’s to look for differences in the local and global structures of these embeddings:</p> <table border="1"> <tr> <th></th> <th colspan="3">Global Structure</th> <th colspan="2">Local Structure</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th colspan="2">Clusters Identifiable</th> <th rowspan="2">Relationship between groups</th> <th colspan="2">Intra-group distribution</th> </tr> <tr> <th></th> <th><span style="color:#a48cf4;">Steroids</span></th> <th><span style="color:#36ada4;">Tetracyclines</span></th> <th><span style="color:#a48cf4;">Steroids</span></th> <th><span style="color:#36ada4;">Tetracyclines</span></th> </tr> <tr> <td>PCA</td> <td>yes</td> <td>no</td> <td>nearby</td> <td>disperse</td> <td>disperse</td> </tr> <tr> <td>t-SNE</td> <td>yes</td> <td>yes</td> <td>far apart</td> <td>disperse</td> <td>tight</td> </tr> <tr> <td>UMAP</td> <td>yes</td> <td>yes</td> <td>nearby</td> <td>disperse</td> <td>tight</td> </tr> </table> <p>Based on these observations, PCA is not as successful at maintaining the structure of these groups within the dataset. Specifically, t-SNE and UMAP highlight the uniqueness and homogeneity of <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span>, whereas PCA spreads the <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span> out amidst various other scaffolds in an unidentifiable way. This again supports that, although PCA maintains a few key elements of the global structure, t-SNE and UMAP preserve the global and local structure more consistently throughout the dataset.</p> <p>Differences between the embeddings are less noticeable when examining the <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> Each method embeds the <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> in a clearly identifiable, yet disperse cluster. UMAP’s <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroid</span> cluster is the most isolated but as discussed earlier, this extra separation is not particularly meaningful. Both PCA and UMAP place the chemically similar <span style="color:#a48cf4;">steroids</span> and <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span> nearby each other while t-SNE does not. This seemingly implies t-SNE’s global structure is not as informative. However, t-SNE places the <span style="color:#36ada4;">tetracyclines</span> near the <span style="color:#97a431;">β-lactam antibiotics</span>, which, as we will read below, actually makes sense.</p> <p>The differences between the methods are most apparent when we examine the <span style="color:#97a431;">β-lactam antibiotics</span>. We see the namesake <span style="color:#97a431;">β-lactam</span> ring present in every compound and, in terms of global structure, all three methods separate out the <span style="color:#97a431;">β-lactam antibiotic</span> compounds as significantly unique from the rest.

However, it is more difficult to decipher the actual quantity of compounds and the nuanced differences between them. When min_dist is large, it is easier to gauge the full spread of the compounds but more difficult to isolate specific clusters. When n_neighbors is small there are meaningful patterns <em>within</em> clusters but the global structure is less interpretable. As this value increases we see the relationships between the clusters becoming more noticeable as the clusters become less sparse.

We start by fitting a UMAP model on a large in-house corpus of drug-like compounds that we consider to be representative of ‘drug-like chemical space’. Now, when we want to examine a new dataset, we load up this cached model and use it to transform the compounds of our dataset into this universal embedding space. With <span style="color:#1864ab;">Dataset Specific</span> embeddings, the dimensionality reduction method itself depends on the relationship between all the compounds in the dataset we seek to visualize. With <span style="color:#e67700;">Dataset-Agnostic</span> embeddings, the dimensionality reduction method is treated as fixed so the location of a given compound is agnostic to the other compounds in the dataset.</p> <p>This allows us to examine multiple datasets all with a consistent frame of reference. We can visualize if the data is diverse and covers a wide area in this drug-like space or if it is contained to a few specific areas.</p> <div class="l-body"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/umap_post/global_data_agnostic_bbbp-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/umap_post/global_data_agnostic_bbbp-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/umap_post/global_data_agnostic_bbbp-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/umap_post/global_data_agnostic_bbbp.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/umap_post/global_chemical_space-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/umap_post/global_chemical_space-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/umap_post/global_chemical_space-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/umap_post/global_chemical_space.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> </div> <p>Here we visualize both the original embedding of our global chemical space compounds used to fit the general UMAP model, and a Dataset-Agnostic embedding of the BBBP dataset created with this fixed model. The compounds of each are colored by their cluster assignment in this embedded space. To get these cluster assignments we have pre-fit a <a href="https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">clustering model</a> on the original global chemical space compounds in their UMAP embedding. We then use this pre-trained clustering model on new datasets to quickly determine which of the global UMAP clusters our new compounds fit into. We can even calculate the percentage of global clusters covered by our new dataset to create a quick, quantitative heuristic of chemical space covered by the dataset.</p> <p>As we saw in our case study, distances in UMAP space aren’t necessarily meaningful and global structure can be greatly influenced by individual compounds. Thus, clusters based off of these embedded distances should be interpreted with caution. However, they can definitely help with the visual examination of the dataset, and can establish a quick, quantitative approximation of chemical space coverage. When combining these cluster heuristics with the visuals of the global embedding, we can start to understand the diversity of a given chemical dataset.</p> <h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2> <p>UMAP is useful because it is easy and quick to create local and global embeddings. This allows us to treat this analysis as a standard piece of our internal pipeline for cleaning, analyzing, and preparing new datasets for analysis and machine learning. Overall UMAP seems to be a great alternative to the more popular methods for dataset embedding, and it would be exciting to see more examples of groups using it for chemical data.</p> <p>This post highlighted UMAP’s value for exploring the chemical space of datasets relevant to drug design. The t-SNE vs. UMAP debate is still greatly contested, but we don’t aim to use this example to prove that UMAP is fundamentally <em>better</em> than t-SNE (although <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549659v1.full.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">many</a> have <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4314" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">argued this</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.877522v1.full.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">some have refuted it</a>, and others have even <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/why-umap-is-superior-over-tsne-faa039c28e99" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">refuted the refutation</a>!) Similarly, even though PCA is less useful for our particular goals, PCA also has many <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/238538/are-there-cases-where-pca-is-more-suitable-than-t-sne/249520#249520" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">advantages</a> over its nonlinear alternatives that make it very useful for other purposes. Ultimately, there are many great dimensionality reduction tools to choose from, but we hope that this post has helped to put UMAP on your map.</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography> </div> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-910Q4XEB22"></script> <script>function gtag(){window.dataLayer.push(arguments)}window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[],gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-910Q4XEB22");</script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> <script src="/assets/js/vanilla-back-to-top.min.js?f40d453793ff4f64e238e420181a1d17"></script> <script>addBackToTop();</script> </body> </html>
