I'm excited about trying to understand what ML models are learning from biological sequences and structures - digging into their embeddings to find [interpretable biological concepts](https://interplm.ai/), figuring out how they pick up these patterns during training, and seeing what biology we can uncover by reverse-engineering the models!

I'm doing a PhD at Stanford University, advised by [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com). I also write ML-bio deep-dives on my [blog (matmols)](https://elanapearl.github.io/blog/), though these are pretty high-effort and thus low-frequency.

Previously I worked at [Reverie Labs](https://www.reverielabs.com/) as an ML engineer helping design small molecule cancer drugs. As an undergrad, I studied Computer Science at Harvard and worked with [Debora Marks](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/) on protein language models. I've also been quite involved with research, fundraising, and patient advocacy focused on [Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrolamellar_hepatocellular_carcinoma).
