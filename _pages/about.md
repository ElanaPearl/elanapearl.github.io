I'm in the third year of my PhD at Stanford University, advised by [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com), working on various projects at the intersection of machine learning and biology. Previously I worked at [Reverie Labs](https://www.reverielabs.com/) as an ML engineer helping design small molecule cancer drugs. As an undergrad, I studied Computer Science at Harvard, worked with [Debora Marks](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/) on protein language models. I also have been quite involved with research, fundraising, and patient advocacy focused on [Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrolamellar_hepatocellular_carcinoma).

Currently I'm very excited about trying to understand what ML models are actually learning from protein sequences and structures - digging into their embeddings to find [interpretable biological concepts](https://interplm.ai/), figuring out how they pick up these patterns during training, and seeing what biology we can uncover by reverse-engineering the models!

I also aim to write up a bunch of ML-bio deep-dives in my [blog (matols)](https://elanapearl.github.io/blog/) but those are pretty high effort thus and low-frequency.
