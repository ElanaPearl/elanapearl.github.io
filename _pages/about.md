<!-- cancer 🧬 machine learning 💻 immunology 🧫 rock climbing 🧗‍♀️ -->
I'm in the second year of my PhD at Stanford University, advised by [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com), working on various projects at the intersection of machine learning and biology (currently immunology and genomics). Previously I worked at [Reverie Labs](https://www.reverielabs.com/) as an ML engineer helping design small molecule cancer drugs. As an undergrad, I studied Computer Science at Harvard and worked with [Debora Marks](https://www.deboramarkslab.com/) on protein language models.

I've also a lot of research on [Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrolamellar_hepatocellular_carcinoma) and still do volunteer work related to FLC and other pediatric cancers. I'm currently one of the directors of the [Fibrolamellar Registry](https://fibroregistry.org/) and a patient advocate for a [cancer grand challenges team](https://cancergrandchallenges.org/teams/koodac) working to develop oncoprotein degraders for pediatric solid tumors including FLC.
