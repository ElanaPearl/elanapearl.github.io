cancer 🧬 immunology 🧫 machine learning 💻 patient advocacy 💚 rock climbing 🧗‍♀️

I'm in the second year of my PhD at Stanford University, advised by [James Zou](www.james-zou.com), working on various machine learning applications in immunology and genomics. Previously I studied Compuer Science at Harvard and have worked on cancer bioinformatics, protein language models, and computational small molecule drug design.

The other side of my career is focused on cancer patient advocacy, mostly related to [Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrolamellar_hepatocellular_carcinoma). I'm currently one of the directors of the Fibrolamellar Registry, a non-profit run by FLC patients, survivors, and families, and I'm one of the patient advocates for a [cancer grand challenges team](https://cancergrandchallenges.org/teams/koodac) working to develop oncoprotein degraders for pediatric solid tumors including FLC.
