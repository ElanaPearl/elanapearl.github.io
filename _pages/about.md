<!-- cancer 🧬 machine learning 💻 immunology 🧫 rock climbing 🧗‍♀️ -->
I'm in the second year of my PhD at Stanford University, advised by [James Zou](https://www.james-zou.com), working on various projects at the intersection of machine learning and biology (currently immunology and genomics). Previously I studied Compuer Science at Harvard and have worked on cancer bioinformatics, protein language models, and computational small molecule drug design.

I also do volunteer work related to [Fibrolamellar Hepatocellular Carcinoma (FLC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibrolamellar_hepatocellular_carcinoma) and other pediatric cancers. I'm currently one of the directors of the Fibrolamellar Registry and a patient advocate for a [cancer grand challenges team](https://cancergrandchallenges.org/teams/koodac) working to develop oncoprotein degraders for pediatric solid tumors including FLC.
